Scenario:

You just started working at a local pet shop, and you mention to your manager that a database might be helpful for the business. They agree, and you are tasked with creating an Entity Relationship Diagram. Here is the basic business model:

Pets are kept in enclosures. Food is fed to the pets. The food is also available to be purchased by customers. The manager would like to have "purchases," for the animals (adopting pets/buying fish) and of the pet food, kept separately. There is also a loyalty program for customers and this can be applied to both the animal purchases and the pet food purchases.
